# Lid-driven cavity problem

## Description
Consider a fluid inside a square cavity of dimension L bounded by four walls. All the walls except the top wall are fixed in space and time. The top wall is given a constant velocity ùë¢ùëáin the u direction, and we 
want to see the development of the u and v velocity profiles of the fluid in the whole domain, as it reaches steady state.

## Governing equations
The incompressible NS equations in primitive variables are given by the equation:

If we apply **2nd order central difference scheme** for space discretization and **2nd order Adams Bashforth** for time discretization, the above equation can be represented as:

## Solution method
The fractional step, or time-splitting, method solves the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations in a segregated manner. At each time step, an incomplete form of momentum equations is integrated to obtain an approximate velocity field, which is, in general, not divergence-free, then the velocity field is projected into the divergence-free field without changing vorticity. This projection step is achieved by solving the Poisson equation for pressure.
